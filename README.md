lua2d-examples
==============

*2d game examples I made using [Love2d] (https://love2d.org/) , a Lua Game Engine.*

* Box2DExample - attaching multiple polygons to an irregularly shaped object with box2d physics capabilities. Created polygon shapes using [Texture Packer] (http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)
* LifeCycle - simple demonstration of the love2d framework lifecycle
* SpriteAnimation - simple demonstration how to animate sprites using Quads. Quads were computed with the help of [Texture Packer] (http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker).
* SquareChase - originally coded in XNA C# from [XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example](http://www.packtpub.com/xna-4-0-game-development-by-example-beginners-guide/book), ported it to love2d. Demonstrated OOP capabilities in lua using the [32 lines of goodness] (https://love2d.org/wiki/32_lines_of_goodness)
